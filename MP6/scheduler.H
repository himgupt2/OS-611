    One way to proceed is to implement the FIFO scheduling policy inside
    class 'Scheduler'. 

    If you plan to implement a Round-Robin Scheduler, derive it from class
    'Scheduler', say as class 'RRScheduler'. The class 'RRScheduler' is 
    really just a FIFO scheduler with THREE MODIFICATIONS:
    1. It manages a timer, which fires at the end-of-quantum (EOQ). 
    (For details on how to set up a timer and how to handle timer interrupts 
    see the 1-second timer in 'kernel.C'.)  The timer is set up in the
    constructor.
    2. It uses an additional function, the EOQ handler. This function gets
    called whenever an EOQ timer event fires. The EOQ handler forces the 
    current thread to call the scheduler's 'yield' function.
    3. The 'yield' function must be modified to account for unused quantum
    time. If a thread voluntarily yields, the EOQ timer must be reset in order
    to not penalize the next thread.
 
    (Note that this qualifies as programming at about the level of a baboon.
     Much better woudl be to have the abstract class 'Scheduler' implement 
     the basic scheduling MECHANISMS and provide abstract funtions to define
     the queue management POLICIES in derived classes, 
     such as 'FIFOScheduler'.)
